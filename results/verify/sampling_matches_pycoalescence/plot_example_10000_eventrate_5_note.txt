plot_example_10000_eventrate_5.pdf
---

These are results I generated using the pycoalescence package combined with do_speciations(),
with the following settings:

* local population size of 10,000
* event rate = 5e-4, and all events were immigrations
* Fisher's Î± = 30 for the mainland
* each max gen is the number of generations back in time before connection with the mainland

The sads are averaged over:

* 5 different trees
* 30 samples per event rate per tree

baseline.py
    Created a baseline scenario from which other scenarios are a variation
    Created to look similar to survey data (but not exactly the same)

increasing_m.py
    Uses results/neutral_area_vs_m/baseline.csv
    Finds the m value that would satisfy each baseline species richness given that J is fixed at the J_critical value (all islands same size)
    Written to results/neutral_area_vs_m/increasing_m.csv

decreasing_m.py
    Uses results/neutral_area_vs_m/baseline.csv
    Finds the m value that would keep the species richness fixed at 25 on each island (J as baseline)

create_parameter_3.py
    Creates a set of parameter values based on varying J x m across the range of values find above (3 x 5 = 15 total)
    They are named things like 'J1_m1', 'J3_m2'
    Stored in results/neutral_area_vs_m/parameter_3_Jm.csv

create_archipelago_params_3.py
    Uses results/neutral_area_vs_m/parameter_3_Jm.csv from create_parameter_3.py to make a more convenient parameter-values collection

create_samples.py
    Uses results/neutral_area_vs_m/archipelago_params_3.csv
    For the parameter sets above (e.g., 'J3_m2'), create 30 archipelagos using the species generator
    Stored in results/neutral_area_vs_m/samples_3.csv
    
The samples are then used by scripts in ../cooccurrence_neutral_area_vs_m

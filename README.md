Using a niche-neutral model as a baseline to compare nestedness and species segregation patterns

**Abstract**

(draft)

Neutral models could theoretically provide a baseline for comparison with empirical species distribution patterns,
including to replace the data-randomised "null" distribution used in segregation and nestedness analysis.
Here, we test the practicality of this suggestion.
We fitted the parameters of the niche-neutral model to species-richness and island-area data,
and developed a sequential sampling algorithm that can efficiently generate randomised presence-absence matrices.
We compared model predictions to observations and identified plausible additional assumptions that improved
fit.
When habitat diversity and immigration rates were assumed homogeneous across islands,
the niche-neutral model's
species-richness predictions that lacked sufficient variability to account for observations.
The model also predicted lower segregation and higher raw nestedness than observed.
However, agreement between model and observations could be improved increasing the realism of model assumptions.
Assuming a positive relationship between island size and niche diversity increased segregation;
and tuning island-specific immigration rate and niche diversity parameters to match
the specific pattern of island richnesses decreased raw nestedness.
We could not directly replace the data-randomised "null" with predictions from the niche-neutral model,
and this is likely true for neutral models in general that assume homogeneity between sites.
However, by extending the homogeneous model to allow niche diversity and immigration to vary across islands,
we identified scenarios by which niche-neutral processes could plausibly produce the observed nestedness and segregation patterns.
Thus, a niche-neutral model may be used to distinguish niche and stochastic drivers of species patterns from more
ecologically interesting mechanisms.
